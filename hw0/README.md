### homework0 due data: Sep. 2 midnight

Data File on Canvas:

## Update here
Moved Previous CMakeLists.txt file to CMakeLists_backup.txt file.

Created a OpenCV CMake example version CMakeLists.txt file, which is connected to the main.cpp file under hw0/

The given image path in the main.cpp is the ../Astronaught.png

## For submission
You must have only source code and headers and build sytem support files.
The input data file (image) is acceptable for hw0/

Depending on your build system:
Use make clean or make distclean or remove an out of source build folder.

Test your submission by doing a fresh clone from your master into a temp folder and ensure it builds / runs on the tc system.
e.g., 
git clone <addr_to_student_work> temp_folder_name
